# Financial Times Cloud Engineer Technical Exercise

This repository stores a website that asks for and stores a simple rating score for using [ft.com](https://www.ft.com/).

This was completed for the Financial Times Cloud Engineer tech test.

## Getting started

To develop with this app:
1. `git clone` this repository.
1. `cd` into the cloned directory.
1. `npm install` to install dependencies.
1. `sudo service mongod start` to start mongod.
1. `npm test` to run tests.
1. `npm run lint` to lint source code.
1. `npm start` to run the app on port 3000.
1. navigate to `localhost:3000` in the browser to use locally hosted app.

## User stories

MVP:
```
As an FT reader,
So that I can give feedback on my experience,
I want to rate ft.com.

As an FT reader,
So that my feedback can be actioned,
I want my rating to be stored.

As the FT,
So that any user can give feedback,
We want the site to be deployed to the cloud (e.g. AWS, Google, Heroku)
```

V2:
```
As the FT,
So that we can assess feedback,
We want to view the ratings.
```

V3:
```
As the FT,
So that our sites have a common aesthetic,
We want the new site to use Origami.
```

## Approach

1. Digested the exercise and wrote this README.
1. Wrote user stories for MVP, V2, and V3
1. Researched technology used by FT to inform architecture decisions.
1. Decided on technologies to use (see Decisions).
1. Diagrammed proposed architecture of app.
1. Setup the basic skeleton of the app.
1. Installed and configured dependencies.
1. Test-drove development starting with most basic user interactions.
